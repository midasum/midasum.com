Precise domain languages improve design clarity and build familiarity. By leveraging domain-specific terminology in our code and documentation, we create systems that are easier to understand, maintain, and extend.

## What Are Domain Languages?

A domain language is a vocabulary specific to a particular problem domain. In software development, this means using terms that domain experts would recognize and understand.

## Why It Matters

When code uses domain terminology:

- **Clarity**: Code reads like a description of the problem
- **Familiarity**: Domain experts can understand what code does
- **Consistency**: Shared vocabulary reduces ambiguity
- **Maintainability**: Future developers can understand intent more easily

## Examples

Consider a banking application. Instead of:

```typescript
function processTransaction(data) {
  // ...
}
```

Use domain language:

```typescript
function executeTransfer(fromAccount, toAccount, amount) {
  // ...
}
```

The second version clearly communicates intent using domain terminology.

## Best Practices

1. **Talk to Domain Experts**: Learn their language
2. **Use Domain Terms Consistently**: Avoid mixing metaphors
3. **Document Domain Concepts**: Create a glossary
4. **Refactor to Domain Language**: Improve code clarity over time

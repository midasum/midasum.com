We're excited to announce the first stable release of vitest-bdd. This plugin brings Gherkin-style BDD testing to Vitest, making it easier to write readable, maintainable tests that describe behavior in plain language.

## What is vitest-bdd?

vitest-bdd is a simple Vitest plugin that enables you to write tests using Gherkin syntax. This approach makes your tests more accessible to both technical and non-technical team members, creating a shared language for describing expected behavior.

## Key Features

- **Gherkin Support**: Write tests using Given-When-Then syntax
- **TypeScript First**: Full TypeScript support with type safety
- **Vitest Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with Vitest's existing features
- **Simple API**: Minimal setup required to get started

## Getting Started

Install the plugin:

```bash
pnpm add -D vitest-bdd
```

Configure it in your `vitest.config.ts`:

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from 'vitest/config';
import vitestBdd from 'vitest-bdd';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [vitestBdd()],
});
```

## Example

```gherkin
Feature: User authentication

Scenario: Successful login
  Given a user with email "user@example.com"
  When the user logs in with password "password123"
  Then the user should be authenticated
```

## What's Next?

We're actively working on improving the plugin and adding more features. Check out the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/midasum/vitest-bdd) for updates and contributions.

Behavior-Driven Development bridges the gap between technical implementation and business requirements. By writing tests in plain language, we create living documentation that stays in sync with our code and helps teams collaborate more effectively.

## The Problem with Traditional Testing

Traditional unit tests often focus on implementation details rather than behavior. This creates a disconnect between what the code does and what it should do from a business perspective. When requirements change, tests break not because behavior changed, but because implementation changed.

## The BDD Approach

BDD encourages writing tests that describe behavior in plain language:

- **Given**: Sets up the initial state
- **When**: Describes the action being taken
- **Then**: Defines the expected outcome

This structure makes tests readable by everyone—developers, product managers, and stakeholders alike.

## Benefits

1. **Shared Understanding**: Everyone speaks the same language
2. **Living Documentation**: Tests serve as executable specifications
3. **Better Collaboration**: Technical and non-technical team members can contribute
4. **Focus on Behavior**: Tests focus on what matters, not how it's implemented
